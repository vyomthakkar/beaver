Schema-Driven Structured Data Extraction

beaver is designed to reliably extract structured data in JSON format from unstructured text inputs. 

A key feature of Beaver is its ability to handle **large and complex JSON schemas** that might otherwise exceed API token limits. It achieves this by intelligently decomposing the input schema into smaller, self-contained "chunks" before processing.
